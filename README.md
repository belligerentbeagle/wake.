# wake.
An alarm app that donates your money away, if you don't wake up.

## What it does
We all hate waking up to an alarm. However, this life-changing seeks to change your entire waking experience. 

Each time our user fails to guess the correct number between 1-20, the amount of money donated doubles. It begins with in-game cookies worth $0.02 cents, and after 10 tries, will expect a maximum of $10.24 to be donated. 

At the end of the month, the total amount to be donated would then be tabulated for the user and he may choose which charity he/she would like to donate to, or they may delete the app and lose out on the fun. 

With leaderboards in place and the ability to add your friends, we motivate users to continue using the application. 

Additionally, one way to stop the alarm is to find a friend who also has the app, and to scan their unique time-sensitive QR code. (Drives adoption and adds social aspect)
